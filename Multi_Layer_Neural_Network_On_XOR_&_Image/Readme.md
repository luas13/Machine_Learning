Mini Project
==============

In this project I implemented and learnt a multi-layer neural network to 
fit the data from the given dataset generator. The machine is implemented 
for the structure provided along with the [test script](test_script.py). 
The API documentation for the test script and other methods are provided 
with the code itself in [napolean]
(http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) 
format, which is popular among most deep learning python programmers and 
is a common style guide. 

The 2 problems solved using MLNN are
1. XOR problem
2. Find whether a given image is of Waldo or Not

Accuracy on XOR data is above 90% while on waldo image it's around 50%. 
More tweaks are needed.

MIT License Included.
