# Convolution Neural Network using YANN

1. In this project we download and create the SVHN dataset.
2. We followed the mat2yann tutorial for converting the
SVHN dataset and prepared it for YANN. 
3. We are free to choose any design for our network, any
architecture with any number of layers (of any type) and
with any number of neurons. 
4. We are also encouraged to try and use any optimizer with 
any set of parameters to learn the produced network. 
5. Our goal is to produce the best accuracy on the SVHN dataset
cooked using the tutorial.We have to get as high a performance 
as possible with as less number of layers (some layers occupy 
less memory than others) and with as less computation as possible.
6. I achieved an accuracy of 97.25.
